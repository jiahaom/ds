## Performance 
- best model: with the highest deployment performance
- evaluate the performance
	- quality metric: to quantify  ^f67765
	- data: to assess
- designed before build
	- avoid data-traps (like confirmation bias)
- focus on test task >>> spilt the data

### Assessing
- test dataset: [[Sampling#^41ffae|a subset of data]], randomly extracted
- test deployment performance: **estimation** of the true performance
- comparing:
	> The Infinite Monkey Theorem
	- lower MSE != better performance [[#^ccf020|random]] can't express

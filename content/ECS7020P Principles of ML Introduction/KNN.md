- doesn't have accuracy and error rate!

## Nearest Neighbours
1.  compare the whole nearest sample
2.  assigned the label of the closest (most similar) training sample


## K Nearest Neighbours
- can be easily implemented in multi-class
1.  compare the K nearest sample
2.  assigned the label of the closest (most similar) training sample
